# ðŸŽ¤ Dual Stream Audio Transcription - Complete Implementation

## âœ… Dual Audio Stream Capture

### **What This Does:**
- âœ… **Captures User Microphone** - What you're saying
- âœ… **Captures Meeting Audio** - What's coming from the meeting/other participants
- âœ… **Combines Both Streams** - Mixes them together for transcription
- âœ… **Real-time Transcription** - Transcribes the combined audio
- âœ… **5-Second Rolling Display** - Shows only last 5 seconds of combined speech

### **Audio Sources Captured:**
1. **Your Microphone** - Your voice and what you're saying
2. **Meeting Audio** - Audio from the meeting platform (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
3. **Combined Stream** - Both sources mixed together for transcription

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### **Step 1: Audio Capture**
1. **User Microphone** - Requests access to your microphone
2. **Meeting Audio** - Requests screen sharing with audio (to capture meeting audio)
3. **Audio Mixing** - Combines both audio streams using Web Audio API
4. **Speech Recognition** - Processes the combined audio for transcription

### **Step 2: Real-time Processing**
1. **Audio Processing** - Mixes user mic + meeting audio
2. **Speech Recognition** - Converts combined audio to text
3. **5-Second Rolling** - Shows only last 5 seconds of speech
4. **Source Labeling** - Indicates which source is speaking

### **Step 3: Volume Control**
1. **User Microphone Volume** - Control how loud your voice is
2. **Meeting Audio Volume** - Control how loud meeting audio is
3. **Mute Controls** - Mute either source independently
4. **Real-time Adjustment** - Adjust volumes while recording

## ðŸš€ How to Test

### **Step 1: Access the Application**
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/meeting/live/meeting_1
```

### **Step 2: Start Dual Stream Recording**
1. **Click "Start"** - This will request two permissions:
   - Microphone access (for your voice)
   - Screen sharing with audio (for meeting audio)
2. **Grant Microphone Permission** - Allow microphone access
3. **Grant Screen Sharing Permission** - Allow screen sharing with audio
4. **Both streams should connect** - You'll see green checkmarks

### **Step 3: Test Audio Sources**
1. **Speak into your microphone** - Your voice should be captured
2. **Play meeting audio** - Meeting audio should be captured
3. **Adjust volumes** - Use sliders to control each source
4. **Test mute controls** - Mute/unmute each source independently

### **Step 4: Test Transcription**
1. **Speak clearly** - Say something into your microphone
2. **Play meeting audio** - Have someone speak in the meeting
3. **Watch transcript** - Should show combined speech from both sources
4. **Check 5-second rolling** - Only last 5 seconds should be visible

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Dual Stream Service (`dualStreamTranscription.ts`)**
```typescript
// Key features:
- MediaStream capture for user microphone
- MediaStream capture for meeting audio (screen sharing)
- Web Audio API for audio mixing
- Gain nodes for volume control
- Combined stream for speech recognition
- 5-second rolling window with source tracking
```

### **Audio Processing Pipeline**
1. **User Microphone** â†’ Gain Node â†’ Combined Stream
2. **Meeting Audio** â†’ Gain Node â†’ Combined Stream
3. **Combined Stream** â†’ Speech Recognition â†’ Transcription
4. **Volume Control** â†’ Real-time adjustment of both sources
5. **Mute Control** â†’ Independent muting of each source

### **User Interface Features**
- âœ… **Dual audio controls** - Separate controls for each source
- âœ… **Volume sliders** - Real-time volume adjustment
- âœ… **Mute buttons** - Independent muting of each source
- âœ… **Connection status** - Shows which streams are connected
- âœ… **Combined transcription** - Shows speech from both sources
